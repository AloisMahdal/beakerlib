# This perl script takes all supplied files or stdin and extracts
# every =pod section that does not include =head1 headings except
# those which contain rhtslib-manual-{header,footer} directives.
#
# Finally it spits out parsed =pod sections in the following order:
# rhtslib-manual-header
# rhtslib-manual-include (all non-=head1 sections included here)
# rhtslib-manual-footer

my $pod = 0;
my $type = '';
my %text = (include => '=head1 FUNCTIONS');

while (<>) {
    # end of =pod section
    if (m/^=cut/) {
        $pod = 0;
    }

    # recognize header/footer and trash =head1's
    $type = 'header' if m/rhtslib-manual-header/;
    $type = 'footer' if /rhtslib-manual-footer/;
    $type = 'trash'  if /^=head1/ && ! ($type =~ m/header|footer/);

    # add to corresponding place
